## Enlightenment âœ¨

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

The ability to focus on what you want to focus on is a crucial skill. It helps you direct your energy, limits distractions, and enables mindfulness.

Too bad controlling your attention can be really hard. Damned brain!

Enlightenment makes it easier to focus. It fades out the contents of previewed notes except for whatever's currently under your pointer. (Technically, it can also do the opposite, _hiding_ whatever is underneath your pointer while showing you everything else. What? I wasn't going to do extra work to prevent you from using it wrong. Yes, I know. Listen. Listen to me! Sometimes, you have to take charge. _Be the user you want to be!_)

There are two modes. In the "all panes" mode, enlightenment fades out the content of every previewed note. In the "active pane" mode, it only works on the currently-active pane.
