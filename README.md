## Enlightenment

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

The ability to focus on what you want to focus on is a crucial skill. It helps you direct your energy, limits distractions, and enables mindfulness.

Too bad controlling your attention can be really hard. Damned brain!

Enlightenment makes it easier to focus. It fades out the contents of previewed notes except for whatever's currently under your pointer. 

There are two modes. In the "full" mode, enlightenment fades out the content of every previewed note. In the "active pane" mode, it only works on the currently-active pane.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/enlightenment-obsidian/`.
